This is a rudimentary of a vim-like text objects functionality for emacs.
For people unfamiliar with vim, text objects are a way of specifying a chunk of text around the cursor with few keystrokes while cutting or copying.

Currently supported text objects are:

i(     text inside parenthesis
a(     like "i(" but including surrounding "(" and ")"
i[     text inside brackets
a[     like "i[" but including surrounding "[" and "]"
i{     text inside braces
a{     like "i{" but including surrounding "{" and "}"
i"     text inside double quotes
a"     like "i"" but including surrounding double quotes
i'     text inside single quotes
a'     like "i'" but including surrounding quotes
i`     text inside backquotes
a`     like "i`" but including surrounding backquotes

Defined sequences are:

C-x w <text object>        cuts the specified text object
C-x W <text object>        copies the specified text object
